## Common Issues and Solutions

### Image Upload Problems

**Issue**: Image won't upload or gets rejected
- **Solution**: Ensure image is under 10MB and in supported format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

**Issue**: Upload is slow or times out
- **Solution**: Resize image to smaller dimensions before upload
- **Solution**: Check internet connection stability

### ASCII Conversion Issues

**Issue**: ASCII output looks distorted or unclear
- **Solution**: Adjust width setting (try 50-150 characters)
- **Solution**: Use higher contrast images for better results
- **Solution**: Try different character sets

**Issue**: Colored ASCII doesn't display properly
- **Solution**: Ensure browser supports colored text display
- **Solution**: Try exporting as HTML for better color rendering

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow conversion or browser freezing
- **Solution**: Use smaller images (under 2MB recommended)
- **Solution**: Close other browser tabs to free memory
- **Solution**: Reduce ASCII width for faster processing

### Export/Download Problems
